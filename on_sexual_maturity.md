# On [Madurez sexual][0]

Is valuable having the opinion on sexual maturity of a thoughtful woman. However, personal experience puts an unnecessary barrier between the readers and the self-knowledge this subject may unleash. There's also an open door for confusing sex and vulgarity, which troglodytes often cross invited or not; and this probably means the author knows how to deal with them. But if the battle against what we consider vulgarity is to be won, expressions like «él la singaba intelectualmente» need a higher fence when used, and I'm convinced the author is passionate about that struggle. There's courage in being so open about oneself, but the local manifest of an emotion trapped in a young woman's mind and body falls short when looked with an universal perspective.
